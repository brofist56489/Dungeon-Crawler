How about we use this as a message board as well. how was your first day at marching band(mb)? Just to let you know, my cousins are coming up, because
my aunt's father only has a few days left, so they are coming to say good bye. because of that i highly doubt i'll be on mumble at all until they
leave, but i still could. talk to you later.

	I think that sounds like a cool idea. since you won't be on i think i will start a smallish "hobby" project. the only thing i am debating is whether to write it in java or python. I could make it faster in python, but java would be more stable and better to distribute. tell me what you think. also with this project i think i will go completly solo.

	I would suggest java, mainly because of it's independance, and you could show it to the java teacher, if it turned into something worth showing. I think that I too shall start a hobby project (int java), and might eventually share it with you. We really should try to finish that game library though. What kind of game do you think you'll make? Do you get weekends off from marching band?

	I am creating a "wave" based survival game but mostly it will just be a tech demo for some stuff i want to try out. I may have been done with it by now, if it wasn't going to be multiplayer. And yes i do have weekends off. (thankfully)
