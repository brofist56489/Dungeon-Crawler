How about we use this as a message board as well. how was your first day at marching band(mb)? Just to let you know, my cousins are coming up, because
my aunt's father only has a few days left, so they are coming to say good bye. because of that i highly doubt i'll be on mumble at all until they
leave, but i still could. talk to you later.

	I think that sounds like a cool idea. since you won't be on i think i will start a smallish "hobby" project. the only thing i am debating is whether to write it in java or python. I could make it faster in python, but java would be more stable and better to distribute. tell me what you think. also with this project i think i will go completly solo.
