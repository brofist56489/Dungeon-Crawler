How about we use this as a message board as well. how was your first day at marching band(mb)? Just to let you know, my cousins are coming up, because
my aunt's father only has a few days left, so they are coming to say good bye. because of that i highly doubt i'll be on mumble at all until they
leave, but i still could. talk to you later.
